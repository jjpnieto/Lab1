<h3>NJIT jmp277 Interior Design</h3>
<p>I moved from Acapulco, Mexico when I was 6 years old. <br> I speak fluent Spanish. New Jersey is the state I moved to and I haven't moved out of the state since. I love listening to music, hanging out with friends and going thrifting. <br> I plan on graduatig with a bachelors in Interior Design, and one of my future plans include trying to start my own business within my field. Within these four years I hope to make many friends and learn many new things.</p>
